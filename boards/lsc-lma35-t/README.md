## Flash memory map

Flash size: 2 MiB / 2,097,152 B / 0x200000

Hex values are in bytes.

Name            | Start    | Length             | End
----------------|----------|--------------------|---------
Bootloader      | 0x000000 | 68 KiB / 0x11000   | 0x011000
App Image       | 0x011000 | 1.1 MiB / 0x121000 | 0x132000
OTA Image       | 0x132000 | 664 KiB / 0xA6000  | 0x1D8000
Key-Value Store | 0x1D8000 | 32 KiB / 0x8000    | 0x1E0000
Calibration     | 0x1E0000 | 4 KiB / 0x1000     | 0x1E1000
TLV Store       | 0x1E1000 | 4 KiB / 0x1000     | 0x1E2000
Network Data    | 0x1E2000 | 4 KiB / 0x1000     | 0x1E3000
User Data       | 0x1E3000 | 116 KiB / 0x1D000  | 0x200000

Bootloader and app partitions contain CRC16 sums every 32 bytes. That results in the actual flash offsets/sizes not aligned to sector boundaries. To simplify calculations, the values shown in the table (extracted from bootloader's partition table) were aligned to 4096 bytes.

## Information

This board has no marking on the front side, only something that looks like PCB manufacturing info on the back; thus it was named based on these symbols.

It can be found in 'LSC Smart Connect Outdoor LED Strip', and is likely custom-made for this product.

The pinout was established by writing to and probing consecutive GPIOs, using the generic board definition.

Pins marked with '?' are currently unknown, with a possibility of being CEN. Pin 22 (P1/D14) is also not confirmed.
